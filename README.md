# 🛒 Real‑World DSA Project: E‑Commerce Order Fulfillment & Recommendation System

This project is a full-scale, microservice-based **E-Commerce backend system** built to demonstrate **real-world implementations of core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. It’s designed with production-grade architecture, scalability in mind, and precise DSA mapping across each service.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Simulate real-world enterprise challenges: product search, inventory management, routing, personalization, analytics.
- Demonstrate how DSAs drive real backend performance, reliability, and scalability.
- Provide a reference-grade project for interviews, portfolios, and system design mastery.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Each service is a self-contained microservice, exposing RESTful APIs and communicating over HTTP. Deployed via Docker/Kubernetes and designed for horizontal scaling and benchmarking.

- API Contracts: OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Stack: Python/Go/Node.js (user choice), Redis, PostgreSQL, Kafka (optional)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker, k8s
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
